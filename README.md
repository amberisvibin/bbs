# bbs (working name)

This is a simple bbs program written in c. The way it is meant to work is that a user would ssh into a server, which would auto-launch this program.

## Building

`bbs` depends only upon `ncurses`. 

`make` builds the program, `make run` will make and then run the program, and `make clean` will clean up the build directory.

## License

The program is distributed under the MIT license. See the `LICENSE` file.
